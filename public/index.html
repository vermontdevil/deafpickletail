This is because I need time to organize the registrations based on payment order. Some players registered but haven't paid yet, while others registered and paid promptly. I'll need to review the timestamps of registration and payments to determine who is officially confirmed to play.</p><p>Thirdly, I'm exploring various options, such as placing some players on a waiting list or extending the tournament times to accommodate late registrations, among other possibilities. These decisions are still pending.</p><p>Finally, let's remain optimistic for the best outcome, ensuring a win-win situation for all involved. In the meantime, I kindly ask for your patience, understanding, and cooperation.</p><p>Thank you, June Prusak Director of 2024 Deaf Midwest Pickleball Tournament</p><h4>Saturday</h4><img class="page_img" src="/images/dmpbt-saturday.jpg" alt="Flyer with Deaf Midwest Pickleball Tourmanet logo.
