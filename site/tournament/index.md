## 2023 Tournament Results

We have completed our second Deaf Midwest Pickleball Tournament on August 12, 2023 in Indianapolis, Indiana. 107 players signed up to play at West Indy Racquet Club. We played Men doubles, Women doubles, and Mixed doubles. It was a wonderful experience despite the heat, rain delays, and a false fire alarm!

You can see all of our <a href="https://pickleballbrackets.com/ptplg.aspx?eid=1f9a5638-4944-4927-b3f4-cd6c048ec73d">medalists and participants on Pickleball Brackets</a>. A big *hands waving* to everyone who came to play and had a blast!

You can see the recording of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/793958674/videos/195671503496650/">livestream video of the tournament via Streamyard</a> thanks to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1802484819925445/?__cft__[0]=AZUsqCtsZ8BaD3xxg7gtKqGU3B3pHT2ZsT4uUx6tvtFy_57g3SjjvjuhmI8Gv-IoWxPX5hrG6xT9SZkWaz_4QGQtjqFKYpEKcn34xHlSiGtbNIhLpE4Bfq3UAqRqhTRV4mvmzWejL0stuu4WoxexzPTqIQtcxeqVAmeKSgnqnVmleWeq_iVVsWwiQ_FKoY-GpblpMV3pVKpG12xarRTF-IQ2&__tn__=-UK-y-R">Indy Deaf Pickleball (Justin Perez, Sebastien Ianno, and Jake Schwall)</a>.

Lastly, without our wonderful sponsors: Heritage Interpreting, Indiana Relay, Selkirk, Gearbox, and Franklin, our tournament wouldn't have been done! Thank you to the sponsors!
