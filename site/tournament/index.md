## Tournament Results

We have completed our first Deaf Midwest Pickleball Tournament on June 19, 2021 in Hoffman Estates, Illinois. It was a wonderful day with almost 90 players particpating in two groups, competitive and recreational. Congratulations to our winners! But more importantly *hands waving* to everyone who came to play, to help out, or just to watch. It was a fun day for everyone, wouldn't you agree?
